# TensorMouse Last Fan Standing

This project is described in https://medium.com/@oceanapplications/how-to-win-a-mercedes-amg-using-tensorflow-4b5b2a20218d

## Getting Started
### Linux/MacOS
1. Make sure you have anaconda installed
2. Open a terminal and navigate to project root
3. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
4. `source activate tensormouse`
### Windows
1. Make sure you have anaconda installed
2. Open a terminal and navigate to project root
3. `conda env create -f environment-win.yml`
4. `activate tensormouse`

## Usage
```
python tensormouse.py
```
Optional arguments (default value):
 * `--source=0` Device index of the camera
 * `--object=cup` Object name - name of object to track (see graphs/labels.json for available options) 
 * `--graphpath=ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_11_06_2017` Path to frozen tensofrlow graph 


Wait for `âœ“ TensorMouse started successfully!` message to use the application.

Use CTRL for clicks and ALT for cursor draging.
Exit by clicking CAPS_LOCK

## Requirements
- [Anaconda / Python 3.5](https://www.continuum.io/download)
- [TensorFlow 1.3](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [OpenCV 3.1](http://opencv.org/)

## Technologies Used
- [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
- [COCO dataset](http://mscoco.org/dataset/)
- datitran/object_detector_app

## Notes
- Make sure you have good lighting when using TensorMouse
- Frame rate will be very low on low performing machines
- Object deteciton on screen edges is poor. (todo: scale cursor movement so that near edge object movements will move cursor to edge)
